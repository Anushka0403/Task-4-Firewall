# Task-4-Firewall
Cyber security internship task-4 Setup and Use Windows Firewall

## What I Did
- Opened Windows Firewall settings
- Created a rule to block port 23 (Telnet) for security
- (Optional) Allowed port 22 (SSH)
- Deleted the test rule after verifying it worked
- Took screenshots of each step

## Screenshots
All screenshots are in the screenshots/ folder:
- firewall_main.png – Firewall settings open
- block_port23.png – Rule to block port 23
- rule_removed.png – Rule deleted

## What I Learned
- How to create and manage firewall rules
- Importance of blocking unused or insecure ports
- How to test and revert firewall changes safely

## Key Points
- Port 23 (Telnet) is insecure and should be blocked
- Inbound rules control incoming traffic
- Firewalls help protect systems from unauthorized access
